## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Electric Eel or newer
- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK with minimum API level 24
- Google Play Services (for ML Kit)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd scribe-ai
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**
   - Create a `local.properties` file in the project root
   - Add your Gemini API key:
     ```properties
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to and select the cloned directory

4. **Build the Project**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete
   - Resolve any dependency issues if prompted
   - Build the project: `Build > Make Project`

5. **Run the Application**
   - Connect an Android device (or create an emulator)
   - Select your device in the toolbar
   - Click the "Run" button (green play icon)
   - The app will be installed and launched on your device

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device
- Check Android Studio's Event Log for detailed error messages
- Verify Gradle sync completed successfully
- Confirm all SDK components are installed via SDK Manager
